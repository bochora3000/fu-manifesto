    <h1>The F.U. Manifesto</h1>
    
    <p>We are uncovering the worst possible ways to build software and ensuring no one ever enjoys their job. Through our suffering, we have come to value:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bureaucracy and control</strong> over individuals and interactions</li>
        <li><strong>Pointless documentation</strong> over working software</li>
        <li><strong>Legal battles and endless approvals</strong> over customer collaboration</li>
        <li><strong>A rigid, outdated plan</strong> over responding to change</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That is, while the items on the right could theoretically help, we actively reject them to maintain maximum inefficiency and frustration.</p>

    <h2>The F.U. Principles</h2>

    <p>We pledge to uphold these 12 commandments of dysfunction:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Our highest priority</strong> is protecting our asses, not delivering software. If it works, that’s a happy accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Deliver nothing until it's perfect</strong>, which means never. Customers don’t know what they want anyway.</li>
        <li><strong>Business people and developers must never talk</strong>—communication only happens through 100-page requirement docs written by people who don’t code.</li>
        <li><strong>Change is the enemy.</strong> Lock everything in stone upfront and pray the market never shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Developers are cogs, not creatives.</strong> Their job is to follow instructions, not think.</li>
        <li><strong>Who cares if the software works?</strong> If the documentation is impeccable, we call it a success.</li>
        <li><strong>Every request</strong> must go through a Kafkaesque approval process—if it doesn’t take months, we’re doing something wrong.</li>
        <li><strong>Launches are for the weak.</strong> The real goal is eternal beta with no accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>No autonomy, no innovation.</strong> Every decision must be made by an executive who hasn't coded in 20 years.</li>
        <li><strong>User feedback is irrelevant</strong>—the system is perfect; the users are just idiots.</li>
        <li><strong>The best architectures</strong> come from endless meetings, PowerPoints, and consultants who have never shipped a product.</li>
        <li><strong>Every sprint</strong> should end with a post-mortem on why the team failed and how to add more process to make failure more certain next time.</li>
    </ul>
