        <h1>🚨 Manifesto for F.U. Software Development 🚨</h1>
        <p>We are uncovering the most painful, dysfunctional, and soul-crushing ways to build software.</p>
        <p>Through our suffering, we have come to value:</p>
        <p>🤡 Bureaucracy and manipulation over individuals and interactions 🤝</p>
        <p>📜 Eternal, mind-numbing documentation over working software 💻</p>
        <p>⚖️ Legal battles, approval chains, and corporate politics over customer collaboration 🤷</p>
        <p>📅 A rigid, outdated, and untouchable roadmap over responding to change 🔄</p>
        <p><strong>That is, while the items on the right could be useful, we actively reject them to ensure maximum inefficiency, frustration, and despair.</strong></p>

        <h2>🔥 The F.U. Principles 🔥</h2>
        <p>We pledge to uphold these 12 commandments of dysfunction:</p>
        <p>🛑 Cover your ass first. Our highest priority is not delivering software but making sure no one can blame us when things fail.</p>
        <p>🐌 Delay everything indefinitely. The only good software is perfect software, which means it should never ship.</p>
        <p>🚷 Developers and businesses must never communicate. All discussions must be funneled through a labyrinth of requirement documents written by people who don’t code.</p>
        <p>🗿 Change is evil. Everything must be decided upfront, locked in stone, and never revisited. If the market shifts, that's their problem.</p>
        <p>🤖 Developers are disposable. They should follow orders, not think. Creativity leads to inefficiency.</p>
        <p>📚 If it’s documented, it’s done. Whether or not the software works is irrelevant—if the documentation is 500 pages, we call it a success.</p>
        <p>🐢 Approval processes must be excruciating. If a request doesn’t take at least six months and involves three different committees, something goes wrong.</p>
        <p>🚀 Releases should be feared. Launches only invite criticism. The true goal is an eternal beta where nothing is ever final.</p>
        <p>👑 Decisions must be made by those farthest from the problem. Preferably by an executive who hasn't coded since the 90s.</p>
        <p>🙉 Users are the problem, not the software. If customers struggle, it's because they’re too stupid to use our perfect system.</p>
        <p>📊 Architecture by committee. The best designs come from endless meetings, PowerPoints, and consultants who have never shipped a product.</p>
        <p>⚰️ Failure is an opportunity… to add more processes. Every sprint should end with a post-mortem on why the team failed, followed by adding more bureaucracy to guarantee even worse failure next time.</p>
        <p>🚫 Agile is for weaklings. True professionals drown in red tape, worship process over progress, and take pride in how much pain they can inflict on themselves and their teams.</p>
